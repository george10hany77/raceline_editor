# üèÅ RaceLine Editor

**RaceLine Editor** is a lightweight toolkit that allows you to overlay, manually edit, and extract racing lines from map images for custom path optimization.

## üß∞ Requirements

- üêç Python 3.7+
- üé® [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for manual pixel editing

## üìÇ Folder Structure


raceline_editor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ original_racinglines/     ‚Üê Place your input racingline files here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mod_maps/                 ‚Üê Modified maps go here (e.g. mod_map.png)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output_racinglines/       ‚Üê Final extracted racing lines output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ racingline_drawer/src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ drawer.py             ‚Üê Drawer script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ path_extractor/src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ extractor.py          ‚Üê Extractor script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md


## üö¶ How to Use

Follow the steps below **in order**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Place your input racingline

Put your 'csv' racingline file into:

original_racinglines/


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the drawer script

python3 -m racingline_drawer.src.drawer


This generates a `mod_map.png` in `mod_maps/` with your racing line overlaid.

![drawnRacingline](assets/mod_map.png)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Open the image in GIMP

Launch GIMP and open:

mod_maps/mod_map.png


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Avoid yellow pixels ‚ö†Ô∏è

If your racingline **crosses any yellow "configured" pixel**, you must manually adjust it. These yellow pixels are reserved areas that should not be overridden.

üü° Yellow = Off-limits

![yelloPixel](assets/wrong_line.png)

Make it like this:

![fixing](assets/fixing.png)

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Mark the path manually

* Add **1 start pixel** (e.g. green)
* Draw a **continuous path** (e.g. purple)
* Add **1 end pixel** (e.g. blue)

> ‚úÖ **All pixels must be adjacent in one of the 8 directions** ‚Äî no gaps allowed!

üß≠ Your path must be 8-connected (including diagonals).


### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Run the extractor script

python3 -m path_extractor.src.extractor

This extracts your manually edited path and saves the result in:

output_racinglines/

You get:

* A file with path coordinates


## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Problem                     | Fix                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå Start/end pixel not found | Make sure they're unique, visible, and saved before closing GIMP |
| ‚ùå Path crosses yellow pixel | Carefully move it away using GIMP's tools                        |
| ‚ùå Disconnected path         | Ensure all pixels are 8-connected with no gaps                   |
| ‚ùå Output is empty or wrong  | Double-check pixel color, spacing, and map resolution            |

## üìå Quick Command Recap

# Step 1: Draw racing line

python3 -m racingline_drawer.src.drawer

# Step 2: Edit mod_map.png in GIMP (no yellow pixels, 8-connected path)

# Step 3: Extract pixel path
python3 -m path_extractor.src.extractor
